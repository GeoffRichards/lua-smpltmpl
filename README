This Lua library provides a simple text/HTML templating system.

See the documentation in the 'doc' directory (in POD and man(1)
format) for details.  The documentation is also available online
at the module's website:

This module includes C code that needs to be compiled.  For Linux
systems the Makefile provided should do the trick.
